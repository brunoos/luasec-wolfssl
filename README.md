# LuaSec with WolfSSL

Some notes:

* Compile WolfSSL with --enable-opensslextra
* DO NOT enable TLS 1.3
* Client MUST configure a CA file or a CA path
* The code base is based on LuaSec 0.7, but the API is almost the same as LuaSec 0.4

This is a in progress work... low priority.
Some help with WolfSSL is welcome.
